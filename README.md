# ðŸ§  Brain-Tumor-MRI-Image-Classification
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for classifying brain MRI images into multiple categories according to tumor type. It involves building a custom CNN model from scratch and enhancing performance through transfer learning using pretrained models. The project also includes deploying a user-friendly Streamlit web application to enable real-time tumor type predictions from uploaded MRI images.

# ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Business Use Cases:
# * AI-Assisted Medical Diagnosis:
 Provide radiologists with AI-powered tools to quickly classify brain tumors based on MRI images, reducing diagnostic turnaround time and increasing accuracy.
# * Early Detection and Patient Triage:
 Automatically flag high-risk MRI images for immediate specialist review, improving hospital workflow and patient care prioritization.
# * Research and Clinical Trials:
 Use AI classification tools to segment patient datasets by tumor type, aiding in research studies and clinical trial recruitment.
# * Second-Opinion AI Systems:
 Deploy AI-powered classification tools in telemedicine or remote consultation setups for second-opinion diagnostics in under-resourced healthcare regions.

 # ðŸ“Œ Project Deliverables:
* Trained models: custom CNN and pretrained models (.h5).
* Streamlit application for tumor classification.
* Python scripts or notebooks for training, evaluation, and deployment.
* Model comparison 
* Public GitHub repository with README.
* Maintain clean, modular, and well-commented code.
